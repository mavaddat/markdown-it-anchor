## [8.6.6] - 2022-12-18

* Support native ESM modules with TypeScript. ([#118])

## [8.6.4] - 2021-05-11

* Update TypeScript types to properly reflect the export style of
  `@types/markdown-it`. Also use `export default anchor` in type

  `import anchor from 'markdown-it-anchor'` and `import anchor = require('markdown-it-anchor')`
  syntaxes instead of being forced to the latter. ([#106])

## [8.1.0] - 2021-07-01

* Depend on any markdown-it version. ([#76])

## [6.0.1] - 2020-11-19
* Added `example.html` test case.
* Added `uniqueSlugStartIndex` test case.
* Fix `equal` -> `strictEqual`.
* Updated dependencies -> `found 0 vulnerabilities`.

## [6.0.0] - 2020-09-29
* Allow to configure unique slug start index, and make it 1 instead of 2
  to mimic what markdown-toc, github-slugger, and GitHub itself does by
  default. This should improve out of the box compatibility with other
  packages. ([#74])

## [5.3.0] - 2020-05-12

## [5.2.0] - 2019-05-28
* Added support for unpkg
* Added support for mjs
* Fix Babel issue, support ES modules. ([#40], [#46])
* New option `permalinkSpace` makes possible to suppress the whitespace
  between the permalink and the header text value. Defaults to `true`. ([#52])
* Fix duplicate ID edge case. ([#35])

## [5.0.1] - 2018-06-14
* `trim()` before `toLowerCase()` to prevent dashes as prefixes and suffixes.

## [5.0.0] - 2018-06-14
* New contributor: [**@nagaozen**](https://github.com/nagaozen)
* Drop `string` package in favour of `encodeURIComponent`. ([#44], [#43], [#38], [#17], [#45])

* Support code in titles. ([#27])
* Support individual header level selection. ([#27])

## [3.0.0] - 2017-02-06

* Add a live example. ([#13])

## [2.3.2] - 2015-11-29
* Test against markdown-it 5.
* Keep assigning `module.exports` after Babel 6 upgrade (that assigns
  `exports.default` only instead), using
  `babel-plugin-add-module-exports`. ([#12])

## [2.3.1] - 2015-11-29
* Remove hard dependency on markdown-it and replace `lodash.assign` with
  `Object.assign`. ([#11])
* Move to Babel 6.
* Use `babel-plugin-transform-object-assign` to have `Object.assign`
  work in ES5 environments.
* Add the permalink during compilation instead of rendering.

## [2.3.0] - 2015-08-13
* Allow to pass HTML as permalink symbol. ([#8])

## [2.2.1] - 2015-08-13
* Do not crash when permalink is enabled and headers below specified
  level are present. ([#7])

## [2.2.0] - 2015-07-20

* Set `aria-hidden` on permalink anchor.

## [2.0.0] - 2015-05-28
* Place the permalink after the header by default. ([#3])

  If you want to keep the old behavior, set the `permalinkBefore` option
  to `true`:

  ```js
  const md = require('markdown-it')
    .use(require('markdown-it-anchor'), {
      permalink: true,
      permalinkBefore: true
    })
